# Processing_With_Disaster_Tweets
Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets - Kaggle Competition

Project Overview In this Kaggle competition, we aim to leverage natural language processing techniques to classify tweets into two categories: those related to real disasters and those that are not. This task has important applications in disaster response and information dissemination. Our solution involves the following components:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the tweet data for model training. Feature engineering: Extracting relevant features from the text data. Model selection: Evaluating and selecting the best machine learning or deep learning models. Model training: Training the selected model on the training dataset. Model evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using various evaluation metrics. Inference: Making predictions on the test dataset and generating submission files for Kaggle.
